For SWISS models and Robetta models RMSD calculations: 
Use the determined structure of SARS-CoV-2 Spike: 6vxx.pdb
*Note that Robetta models predict only one chain of the Spike protein rather than the entire protein.

For Galaxy models RMSD calculations:
Use the determined structure of SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain: 6lzg.pdb
